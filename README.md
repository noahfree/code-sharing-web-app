# cs4830-final-project
This is my group's final project for CS4830 Advanced Web Development in Fall 2021. It is essentially a web application for sharing pieces of code. We created the application using Java Spring (backend) and Angular (frontend).

There are many improvements that could be made to this project, but overall I was able to learn a lot by working on this especially in regards to working on a team, allocating time, and planning how to create a system from beginning to end.
